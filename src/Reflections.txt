Estimated time on the exercise: 2-4 hours
Status of the code: Working!

Difficulties
-	Some of the codes were missing some crucial parts(my group included) so that I need to read and understand
    the whole structure of the code that my friends wrote.
    
-	While trying to understand the code, I face some problems since everybody have a unique style of code writing.

-	Some of these problems were different names for the properties, some code parts that was not working with the main method etc.

Ways to avoid the problems  
-	I saw that some of my friends write good comments on their codes. 
    This is a great way to avoid the problems because I understood the code by just reading their comments.
    
-	If we can stick on the names of the properties or methods all the time there will be no problem to connect the class and the main method together.
